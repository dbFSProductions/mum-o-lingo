// captured with autoGainControl off on purpose, and the pitch tracker needs
// that honest signal.
//
// Loudness. autoGainControl being off leaves a recording far quieter than the
// Azure voices, which made the you-vs-model comparison lopsided. Both halves
// are measured over their own speech and brought to the same line: a quiet
// take is boosted up to it, and a TTS clip that arrives above it is brought
// down. Matching is the whole job, so it has to work in both directions —
// only ever boosting left the model wherever Azure happened to put it, and
// Azure puts it above the line a recording can reach, so You stayed the
// quieter of the two however hard the boost worked. Boost-capped so a
// near-silent take doesn't become amplified hiss, and soft-limited on the way
// out so a peak can't clip.
//
// Dead air at the front. You tap record, then think, then speak, so playback
// opened with a second of nothing. It starts at speechStart() instead — the
// same clip-derived detector trimSilence() draws and times the clip by, so the
// picture, the sound and the pacing note all agree about where you began.
//
// Only the front, here. The end of a Spanish word carries a lot — the final -s
// that marks a plural or a "you", the -n on a third-person plural, the -d on
// an usted imperative — and a trailing trim that misjudges the threshold eats
// it, so playback leaves the tail alone, silence and all.

   to — at 1.0 the peak decides the gain again, just with a politer name.

   The number comes from the crest factor, the peak over the level of the
   words. The cap binds once the crest is over `CEILING * OVERSHOOT /
   TARGET_RMS`, so 1.25 covers everything up to a crest of about 7.7 — speech
   sits around 4 to 8, and a TTS clip is flatter than that, nearer 3. Past

/* How loud the voice actually is, and how much room a boost has to leave —
   both read from the speech with transients thrown out, which is the whole
   fix here.

   A 20 ms knock — a tap on the phone as you reach for the stop button, the
   table, a plosive straight into the mic — is louder than anything you said,
   and it used to poison this twice over. It set `peak`, so `0.98 / peak`
   pinned the gain near 1.0 and `gain > 1.1` came out false, so *no boost was
   applied at all*; and it sat inside the trimmed region, so it dragged the
   average level up and asked for less gain in the first place. The phrase then
   played back exactly as faintly as it was recorded while the model played at
   full TTS level. Measured on a synthetic take needing 2.9× to reach TTS
   level: one click took it to 1.0×.

   Worse, it is a cliff rather than a slope. The same voice in the same room is
   boosted on the go with no knock in it and not on the go with one, which is
   what "the playback seems to have got quieter" actually looks like from the
   outside.

   So both numbers come from the frames that are plausibly voice, and that is
   a window with a lid and a floor. Anything more than four times the
   90th-percentile frame is a knock, not a word — twelve dB above a loud vowel
   is not something a person does mid-phrase. Anything under a fifth of it is
   the gap between two words, not a word either, and counting those is what
   made this measure the two halves differently: a recording pauses and a TTS
   clip is speech end to end, so the pauses dragged the recording's average
   down and asked for a boost that then overshot the model it was supposed to
   match. Both are now read over the words alone. Whatever the boost then
   overshoots by is caught by `softLimit` on the way out, rather than being
   allowed to veto the boost for the whole phrase. */
